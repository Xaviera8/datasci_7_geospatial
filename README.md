## Errors and Issues

### 
The only issue that I had was when I was using a for loop to iterate through the list of coordinates, I kept receiving the error message. I tried to change the encoding of the string but this only presented more issues. To resolve this, I attempted the code with only one value and it worked. I think created a function and iterated through the list with the function and this presented no issues.
